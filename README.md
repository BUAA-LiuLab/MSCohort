**Please download the latest version of MSCohort in the release area on the right.**

# Overview
MSCohort is a tool for extracting comprehensive metrics and assisting users in evaluating and optimizing the performance of DIA proteomics data. The workflow of MSCohort consists of two modules: Intra-experiment analysis and inter-experiment analysis. Intra-experiment analysis enables the systematic evaluation and optimization of individual DIA experiments. Inter-experiment analysis enables the systematic quality evaluation and low-quality experiments detection for large cohort experiments.

More importantly, MSCohort provides a comprehensive quality assessment report for large-scale experiments, which assists in detecting the variations across experiments and instruments, flagging low-performing experiments, and correcting the heterogeneity between experiments, to facilitate data quality control and experimental standardization with large cohort studies. It enables the analysis of vendor data generated from Thermo Orbitrap, Bruker timsTOF, and SCIEX ZenoTOF instruments. Taken together, these features make MSCohort a valuable software tool for evaluating and optimizing the performance of experiments for large cohort proteomics studies.
